      "\n",
      "1.  Pre-service claim: A claim is a pre-service claim if the receipt of the benefit is conditioned, in whole or in \n",
      "part, on receiving approval in advance of obtaining the medical care, unless the claim involves urgent care, as \n",
      "defined below. Benefits under any Plan that require approval in advance are specifically noted in this book as \n",

      "\n",
      "2.  Urgent care claim: A claim involving urgent care is any pre-service claim for medical care or treatment to \n",
      "which the application of the time periods that otherwise apply to pre-service claims could seriously \n",
      "jeopardize the claimant’s life or health or ability to regain maximum function or would — in the opinion of a \n",

      "involves urgent care, the claim shall be treated as an urgent care claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Post-service claim: A post-service claim is any claim for a benefit under this Plan that is not a pre-service \n",
      "claim or an urgent care claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Concurrent care claim: A concurrent care decision occurs when the Claims Administrator approves an \n",

      "There are two types of concurrent care claims:\n",
